By day I'm a -software developer/architect- Engineering Manager (whatever that means) with background in ops, apps, infrastructure, and security. I've worked at companies big and small and love to solve problems.  Even though I've moved to the dark side I still code just about every day and now help lead an Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) team.

When I'm's not working I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee, various other outdoor activities, running around with my kids, photography, and geeking out learning/playing with new technologies.  On the weekends I volunteer my time running audio/visual setup for my Church. 

Any thoughts and opinions expressed on this site are my own.
