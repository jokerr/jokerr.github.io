By day I'm a software developer/architect with background in ops, apps, and security. When I'm's not working I enjoy 
various outdoor activities, running around with my kids, photography, and geeking out learning/playing with new 
technologies.  On the weekends I volunteer my time running audio/visual setup for my [Church](http://heightscc.com/).
