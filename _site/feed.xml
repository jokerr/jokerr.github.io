Two of those eight years have been on the Revolutionary Development (RevDev) Team where we’ve implemented various disruptive and innovative features for our members.

Linux was the desktop for me and the only reason to run Windows was to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/wow&quot;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. My how times have changed and I must say I’m liking the new and improved Microsoft. They have a great tablet in the latest Surface Pro series. Office has always been one of their flagship products but they loosened the grip on it a bit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2014/11/dropbox-microsoft-office-partnership/&quot;&gt;DropBox integration&lt;/a&gt; and support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehub&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/microsoft-corporation/id298856275&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Windows 10 looks promising, heck I’m installing a preview now?! And probably my biggest surprise is the they put a lightweight IDE on all platforms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if they would put in a real command line shell I’m sold!  Cygwin is decent and in all fairness I haven’t given PowerShell a real go but what can I say, I’m a forward slash kind of guy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="general" /><category term="microsoft" /><summary type="html">If you asked me 10 years ago what I thought of Windows I wouldn’t have too many nice things to say about it.
