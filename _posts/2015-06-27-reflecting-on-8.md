It's a little hard for me to believe that I've been at <a href="http://www.usaa.com" target="\_blank">USAA</a> for eight years this July. Since I started there in 2007 I've worked in just about every type of team you can find at such a large organization; maintenance and support, operations, infrastructure, and delivery. Two of those eight years have been on the Revolutionary Development (RevDev) Team where we've implemented various disruptive and innovative features for our members. I'd love to say more about the other projects but...yeah...NDA.
