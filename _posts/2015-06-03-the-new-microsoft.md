If you asked me 10 years ago what I thought of Windows I wouldn't have too many nice things to say about it. Linux was the desktop for me and the only reason to run Windows was to play [World of Warcraft][wow]. My how times have changed and I must say I'm liking the new and improved Microsoft. They have a great tablet in the latest Surface Pro series. Office has always been one of their flagship products but they loosened the grip on it a bit with [DropBox integration][ms-dropbox] and support for [Android][ms-android] and [iOS][ms-ios]. Windows 10 looks promising, heck I'm installing a preview now?! And probably my biggest surprise is the they put a lightweight IDE on all platforms! 

Now if they would put in a real command line shell I'm sold!  Cygwin is decent and in all fairness I haven't given PowerShell a real go but what can I say, I'm a forward slash kind of guy.
